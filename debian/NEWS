monit (1:5.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Support of the "startup" option in /etc/default/monit and
  setting initial delay with /etc/monit/monit_delay has been removed.

  Please, use START option to enable/disable monit startup during boot.

monit (1:5.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Since version 1:5.3.1-2 of the package monit binary has been
  installed to /usr/bin/ (instead of /usr/sbin/).  This is an upstream
  default and common for the monit packaging in other systems (e.g.
  FreeBSD, Gentoo, ALTlinux) as well.
